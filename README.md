- 👋** Hi there! I’m Hanny**
- 🔭 I’m currently building a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for user 
- 🌱 I’m teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and web development
- 💞️ I love to create pretty things, such as latte art and websites 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied public health in Vietnam, I moved to Australia to work as barista to save money to study in Australia, 
now I'm studying Master of IT at Flinders University.
I am passionate about software development so I've been spending a lot of time teaching myself programming skills. 
Also, I'm proud to be an apprentice software developer of Udacity 😁
