- 👋** Hi there! I’m Sally**
- 🔭 The technologies I work with are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS and web development.  
- 💞️ I love to create pretty things, such as latte art and websites 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied public health in Vietnam, I moved to Australia to work as a barista and customer service to save money to study in Australia, 
now I am an IT graduate from Flinders University.
I am passionate about software development so I've been spending a lot of time teaching myself programming skills.
